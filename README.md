# osx-terminal-themes
A collection of my customised themes for Mac OS X Terminal app.

I mainly took it from https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized and modified
the colors a little bit since I like the red/green combination from `git diff` and they were lost.

Also, differentiate a little bit the color which some of them where very similar and improved the
text selection color.

This is the result:
